# Relevant material

## Keeping your C# up-to-date
Most of you are still inexperienced programmers and CompSys in very heavy on programming and program understanding. You need to think of programming as a _craft_, like playing an instrument. You have during the first year learned the basics of how it works. But if you lay it away over the summer (do not program for two months) you will lose much of these skills that you have gain over the first year.

It is therefore important that you practice your C# skills and to help you with this we will point you to the follow two resources.

### Edabit
On Edabit you can filter C# problems after level and topic. You can always start with the medium and work your way upwards. I will also recommend problems under the topics `logic` and `string`. There are much relevant to the problems you will face during CompSys.

### Programmr
Programmr is one of the more popular sources of problems and they also have a section on C#.

## The Linux/Unix terminal and its tools
We will extensively use the terminal throughout the course. Being able to work from the terminal is an important skill for a programmer/computer scientist.

To start we will point you to [Over The Wire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) which is a game that helps you get start.

For more expert use, we will point you to the notes from the former course on [Unix-like data processing](uldp17-2018-08-16.pdf).

### Make
We will throughout the course use the build system Make. We strongly recommend that you become familiar with it and it will also be useful in the future. There exists many manuals on the internet, but will suggest this one:
[https://oleks.github.io/compsys-archive/make.html](https://oleks.github.io/compsys-archive/make.html).
In the note on [Unix-like data processing](uldp17-2018-08-16.pdf) you can also find a detailed chapter.

### Shell Scripting
Throughout the course we will give you different shell scripts that can aid your testing of assignments and other tasks. A shell script is useful for automating a sequence commands into a single call. Later in the course it can be useful for you to update these scripts and create new ones based on the ones we have given; or just have the skills for making them in the future.

In the note on [Unix-like data processing](uldp17-2018-08-16.pdf) you can again find a chapter on shell scripting.
